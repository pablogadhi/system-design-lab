# System Design Lab — agent guide

A local, multi-node Kubernetes lab for building system designs end to end: infra components,
FastAPI services, stream pipelines and a thin Next.js client, verified with e2e tests, load tests
and chaos experiments. Nothing is deployed to a cloud. **One design per repo** (created with
`scripts/new-design.sh` from the template; `origin` = the template).

To build a design from a diagram, run the **`/build-design`** skill (`.claude/skills/build-design/`).

## Hard rules

- **Never install anything on the host** (no brew/apt/pip --user/npm -g/curl|sh, no sysctl, no
  changing Docker Desktop settings). If a tool or setting is missing, run `make doctor` and report
  what's missing to the user. Everything else (images, charts, venvs, node_modules) lives in Docker
  or inside the repo.
- **Kubeconfig, helm and tilt state are repo-local** (`scripts/env.sh`): always use the Makefile /
  scripts, or `source scripts/env.sh` first. Never touch `~/.kube/config`. Context: `kind-sdl`.
- **Contracts first.** `design/spec.md` + `design/contracts/` are the source of truth shared by every
  agent. Change a contract only through the orchestrator (it re-dispatches everyone affected).
- **Stay in your lane:** each builder agent writes only the paths it owns (table below).
- Pin versions; look them up (context7, `helm search repo`, release pages) — don't guess.

## Conventions

- **Namespaces:** components in `data`, services + client in `apps`, operators in their own.
- **Connection contract:** component `<name>` publishes Secret `apps/<name>-conn`; a service lists
  it under `connections:` in `services/<svc>/deploy/values.yaml` and gets env vars `<NAME>_<KEY>`
  (e.g. `POSTGRES_URL`, `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`). Keys per component: `infra/components/AUTHORING.md`.
- **Services** (see `services/sample-api` as the reference):
  - FastAPI via `sdl_common.create_app(settings, lifespan=…, readiness=…)` → `/healthz` (liveness,
    never checks deps), `/readyz` (deps), `/metrics`, JSON logs, `X-Served-By: pod@node` header.
  - Entry point `python -m <module>`; one shared `services/Dockerfile` (`SERVICE` build arg).
  - Public routes: `route.pathPrefix: /api/<service>` (prefix stripped; `ROOT_PATH` set for docs).
    Workers: `route.enabled: false`.
  - Keep I/O behind a small repo/client class; unit tests swap it via `app.dependency_overrides`.
  - `test_matches_contract` in every public service: `assert_implements_contract(app, "<service>")`.
  - SQL migrations: `src/<module>/migrations/NNNN_name.sql`, run by `sdl_common.migrate` as an init
    container (`migrations.enabled: true` in deploy values).
- **Client:** relative `fetch('/api/<service>/…')` through `src/lib/api.ts`; types generated from
  the contracts with `pnpm gen:api` (commit `src/api/*.ts`).
- **Replicas & zones:** the chart spreads replicas across zones and adds a PDB; stateful components
  spread via their operator. Design experiments around zones (`chaos/`, `chaos/node-down.sh`).
- **E2E tests** go through the gateway only (black box); use `eventually()` for async flows.
- Only one lab cluster runs at a time on this machine (`kind-sdl`); `make down` before switching designs.
- Docker Desktop: the host cannot reach container IPs; everything is exposed through the gateway's
  NodePort mapped to `localhost:8080`.

## Gotchas learned the hard way

- `kubectl run -i` can drop output of fast commands — use `run_once` from `scripts/lib.sh`.
- NetworkChaos with `direction: to` does nothing for traffic to Services — use `direction: both`
  (details in `chaos/README.md`).
- Don't bump or remove `packageManager: pnpm@12.3.4` in `client/package.json`: `pnpm` here is a
  Corepack shim, and any other version makes it try to download pnpm, which fails offline/sandboxed.
