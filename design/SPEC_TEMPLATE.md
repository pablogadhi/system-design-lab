# <Design name> — spec

> Written by the architect step of `/build-design` from `diagram.excalidraw` + `diagram.png`
> (parsed into `diagram.graph.md`). The user approves this file before any building starts.
> Every builder agent treats this file + `contracts/` as the source of truth.

## 1. Problem
One paragraph: what the system does and for whom (from the diagram's notes).

## 2. Requirements
**Functional**
1. …

**Non-functional (as stated)** — availability, latency, consistency, durability, scale.

## 3. Laptop scale-down
The cluster is 4 workers on one machine. Map every scale number to something runnable and say why
the scaled version still exercises the same behaviour.

| Diagram says | Lab target | Why it still means something |
|---|---|---|
| e.g. 100M clicks/day (~1.2k rps avg, ~10k peak) | 200 rps sustained, 500 rps burst | same partitioning/back-pressure paths, measurable in k6 |

## 4. Components (infra)
One row per piece of infra. `status: exists` = already in `infra/components/`; `new` = infra-builder
creates it following `infra/components/AUTHORING.md` + `PLAYBOOK.md`.

| Component | Profile | Status | Connection contract (secret `<name>-conn` → env prefix) | Design-specific setup |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| postgres | ha | exists | `POSTGRES_URL`, `POSTGRES_READ_URL`, … | tables in `contracts/db/postgres.sql` |

## 5. Services
| Service | Kind | Responsibilities | API (contract) | Consumes | Produces | Stores |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| example-api | FastAPI, public | … | `contracts/openapi/example-api.yaml` at `/api/example-api` | — | topic `x` | postgres |

Kinds: *FastAPI public* (HTTPRoute), *FastAPI internal* (no route), *worker* (consumer, no public API),
*pipeline* (Flink job in `pipelines/`).

## 6. Data & events
- DB schemas: `contracts/db/<component>.sql` (owning service copies them into its migrations)
- Events: `contracts/events/<topic>.schema.json` — JSON Schema, plus key, partitions and retention below

| Topic / queue | Key | Partitions | Producer | Consumers | Delivery semantics |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## 7. Configuration matrix
`contracts/config.md`: for every service, which connections (`connections:` in its deploy values)
and extra env vars it needs. This is how infra-builder and services-builder agree on wiring.

## 8. Acceptance flows (→ `tests/e2e/`)
Numbered, black-box, through the gateway (`http://localhost:8080`). Each becomes one pytest test.
1. **Given** … **when** … **then** … (use `eventually()` for async/eventually-consistent steps)

## 9. Client
Pages/flows the Next.js demo shows (minimal — just enough to demo the flows above).

## 10. Load (→ `loadtest/<design>.js`)
k6 scenarios + thresholds that encode the scaled NFRs.

## 11. Chaos experiments (→ `chaos/`)
Each NFR that is about failure becomes a hypothesis + experiment + how to verify it.

| Hypothesis | Fault | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| no clicks lost if a broker dies | kill 1 Kafka broker under load | count reconciliation: produced == aggregated |

## 12. Open questions / assumptions
Everything the diagram did not say and the architect had to decide (the user confirms these).
